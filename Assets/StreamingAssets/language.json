    "kst_nlr_01": "A resource that splits uranium atoms for generating energy. Uranium is concentrated into fuel rods and has its atoms split using tiny particles. These particles are controlled to avoid causing a dangerous explosion.",
    "kst_nlr_02": "A non-renewable resource that generates energy by splitting uranium atoms. This resource produces no pollutants, and if there are no accidents, only steam is released into the air.",
    "kst_nlr_03": "A non-renewable resource that generates energy by splitting uranium atoms, which also produces radioactive waste. This waste can remain dangerous for hundreds to thousands of years.",
    "kst_nlr_04": "A resource that generates energy by splitting atoms. This reaction creates dangerous radioactive waste, which must be securely stored to prevent harm to people and the environment.",

    "kst_oil_00": "A non-renewable fossil fuel resource that's burned to produce steam to spin a turbine to generate energy. It's a black or dark brown liquid found in rock layers in the Earth's crust.",
    "kst_oil_01": "This resource forms from dead organic material that's buried under sediments, kept away from oxygen, and exposed to both high heat and pressure. It takes millions of years to form, but forms at a lower temperature than natural gas.",
    "kst_oil_02": "A resource that's obtained in a crude form, which has a mix of different hydrocarbons. It's then refined via heating to separate it into different compounds, which all boil at different temperatures.",
    "kst_oil_03": "A non-renewable liquid resource that's burned for generating energy. It can be found by mining on land and at sea, but drilling at sea can cause a spill if something goes wrong.",
    "kst_oil_04": "A non-renewable resource that can be burned for generating energy, and can be refined for various uses When burned, it releases toxic chemicals into the air.",
